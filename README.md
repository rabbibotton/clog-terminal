# CLOG-Terminal

## License BSD 3 clause

clog-terminal uses jQueryTerminal to create a terminal like interface.

jQueryTerminal is located at https://terminal.jcubic.pl/

I plan on adding most of the options and features of jQueryTerminal

Events - on-commmand
Properties - prompt
Methods - echo, exec, clear, reset

Usage with builder:

```
(ql:quickload :clog-terminal/tools)
(clog-tools:clog-builder)
```
